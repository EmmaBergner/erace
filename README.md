As a runner, you become part of a global community. A running race can bring together participants from all over the world to compete with and motivate each other runners.

eRace is a web browser application where runners can find and share running races happening in the world.
We let running athletes quickly find new races and provide a platform where runners can spread and share running races happening over the world. Whether you are looking for a picturesque trail run near you, or going for a holiday and want to find a run in that specific country, you can find or add it here.

## Why use our app?
The information, the recomendation is all based and comes from personal expericenes.

Once logged in, this is the landing page. Here there are two different stages. 
- First time and before any races have been added to "my runs" a message will show with instructions. 
- After adding races to "my runs", the race closest in time will be displayed with a countdown of days, hours, minutes and seconds left  to the start of the race.

The race page shows a list of all races added by users.
